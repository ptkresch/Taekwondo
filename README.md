## About

This application was made with a few major goals in mind:

First - the use of "expo", a powerful technogy that can not only speed up React Native development, but also provide simple tools to manage and create web, iOS, and Android based builds. 
Without a doubt, the ability to test our app using simulators - both on mobile devices, on the web at https://snack.expo.io/, or even on the expo mobile app - is simply a massive improvement to the quality of a developer's life! 

Second - the unification of Web and Native code so that any frontend architecture could establish content parity on each platform. 

Third - to make and design a mobile app out of the website for my Martial Arts studio - the old and currently live website at http://www.powellstaekwondo.com/ is very outdated and I believe it is missing some important features to be used at it's full potential.

Fourth - and certainly not least, is to practice hosting and maintaining a website using a newer technology for me: AWS amplify.

With these goals in mind, it can seem challenging to know where to even begin - as such, I recommend anyone following this project to become acquainted with the basics of expo and it's tools in creating hybrid applications: https://docs.expo.io/

And with that all said....let's run this project, shall we?

## Setup / Installation

To run this application, you will want to make sure you have the expo application installed on your iOS or Android mobile or tablet device.

From there, it's a simple task to add the app to your device for testing purposes - simply navigate to https://expo.io/@ptkresch/projects/ptc and you can open the project in the expo application! 

Alternatively, if you'd like to test the iOS build via TestFlight, I will be happy to send over an invitation for you to download the app!
